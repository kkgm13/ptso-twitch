# Updated Personalized Textual Shoutout Overlay for Twitch (PTSO)


*A Localized and Self-Hosted Twitch Shoutout Overlay system for Twitch Streamers, with personalized streamer-tailored text about a specified streamer via ADMIN section. Overlay trigger is accessible to Twitch Moderators and Channel Streamer only. Using the new Twitch Helix API system.*

## Prerequisites‚ùó
- A LocalHost system running (LAMP/WAMP Stack)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (MacOS use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)]!) & [NodeJS Package Manager](https://npmjs.com)
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) (Will work with StreamLabs [BUT Not Recommended])
    - Ensure Twitch Account is connected and Linked! 
### Example usage:
- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/)
    - If utilizing MAMP, ensure MAMP's Document Root folder calling a folder above this system (eg: DocRootFolder/ptso-twitch/)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
    - If utilizing XAMPP, ensure the ptso-twitch folder is stored in the htdocs folder inside XAMPP.    
## PTSO Dependencies ü§ù
- [Twitch Helix API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/)
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org)
- [Axios-HTTP](http://axios-http.com)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [Santatize-HTMl] (TBC)

## First Time Running
0) Login to [Twitch Dev](https://dev.twitch.tv) and get your Client ID after creating your own Localhost Application
1) Save a copy of the .env.example as .env, and add your Twitch Username & ClientID  (DO NOT DELETE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE for stable usage) 
2) After running ```npm update``` on a Command Prompt/Terminal to start up dependencies, run ```npm run setup-env <Your Twitch UserName>``` to setup the newly created dotenv (.env) file with the extra related information
    - *Note: There maybe a scenario that you will need to rerun```npm run setup-env``` without the extra username argument, now and then if not working correctly.*

## Notes üìù
1) Use the .env.example to provide your personal information **AND SAVE A COPY** as an ".env" file. 
2) Please ensure to clear OBS Browser cache **before and after** stream for safety, especially with extensive data work with Admin Section
3) To have unique lines for a streamer, load up the server and checkout the Admin page on a browser to add unique statements about them.
