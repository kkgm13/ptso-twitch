## Prerequisites‚ùó
- A LocalHost system running (LAMP/WAMP Stack)

    - Specifically For ```npm run setup```
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) (Will work with StreamLabs [BUT Not Recommended])
    - Ensure Twitch Account is connected and linked! 
### Example usage:
- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/)
    - If utilizing MAMP, ensure MAMP's Document Root folder calling a folder above this system (eg: DocRootFolder/ptso-twitch/)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
    - If utilizing XAMPP, ensure the ptso-twitch folder is stored in the htdocs folder inside XAMPP.
